## üß† Introduction

**AVA (Agent-based Virtual Assistant)** is a decentralized, modular personal stylist and upcycling guide built using Fetch.ai's **uAgents framework**. AVA is a multi-agent system that helps users:
- Analyze their body type, face shape, and color palette
- Get fashion advice based on current trends
- Suggest personalized outfit recommendations
- Offer upcycling ideas for old clothing to promote sustainability

---

## ‚ùì Problem Statement

Finding personalized fashion advice and keeping up with daily trends is overwhelming. Moreover, most people discard old clothes instead of creatively reusing them, contributing to fashion waste.

---

## üéØ Objective

To build an intelligent and autonomous style advisor using the Fetch.ai ecosystem, combining:
- AI-driven personalization
- Global fashion trends
- Circular fashion through upcycling
- Privacy-respecting architecture via uAgents

---

## ü§© Solution Overview

AVA uses four specialized autonomous agents managed by a Bureau:
1. **Body Analyzer Agent**
2. **Stylist Agent**
3. **Upcycler Agent**
4. **Chatbot Agent**

These agents communicate using Fetch.ai's `uAgents` protocol to deliver real-time and personalized fashion experiences.
